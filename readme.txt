As a benefit to Subscription DNA&reg; clients who use WordPress, this plugin can be enabled and speeds up integration and provides a number of custom tools to help quickly tie in the subscriber functionality. Our support team provides hands on integration help and custom enhancements as needed.

= Please Note: =
This plugin ONLY works as an integration interface with an active/paid account to Subscription DNA, our full-featured SaaS cloud billing, paywall and membership management platform. You'll need a Subcription DNA account to be able to activate the plugin.  For production, you will need a payment gateway supporting tokenization and an SSL Certificate. We do support Paypal standard for payments, however, a payment gateway is ideal for utilizing the full power of Subscription DNA.
